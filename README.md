# Sorting Algorithim Speeds on Various Sizes, Complexities, and Distributions
## Creator: Jay Mody

WIP project, the idea is simple, show how the popular basic sorting algorithims perform when:
- the size of the array increases
- the distribution is changed from uniform, reverse, unique, normal

Obviously, sorting algorithims have been thouroughly studied, tested, and there are countless interpretations, tests and visualizations to demonstrate how they work and perform. 

This is simply my take on it. I'm doing this to gain a better insight on each sorting algorithim and to practice/familiarize myself with them.
